# ESPHome-Items
My configs for ESPhome

If you would like to implement this into your own systems, please note that you *will* need to change the power states to monitor and may need to add/remove stages per device

I will attempt to include a tutorial for adapting this to your own setup as I flesh the system out.

HEAVILY based on work done by Gio-Dot within their project https://github.com/Gio-dot/Washing-Machine-Sonoff-Pow-R2-Esphome
